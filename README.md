# Benchmarking of Neural Network performance between PyTorch and Flux on Julia for High Performance Computing
## Team Members
Pratyush Shukla (ps4534) and Yufeng Duan (yd2284)

## Goal/Objective
Our aim is to test the performance of Julia’s Deep Learning ecosystem using Flux.jl package against Python’s PyTorch and assess whether Julia’s motto of “Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like C/Fortran” is justified. We aim to perform a detailed benchmarking analysis of PyTorch and Flux.jl performances on Neural Network training and hyperparatnmeter optimization over the High Performance Computing system.
